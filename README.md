# MyLibraryApp
it's a traning asset done throughout Mesam's online course you can reach at [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fis26HvvDII)
or an [official website](https://freeCodeCamp.org)

## Additional functionality:
- [EditBookActivity](app/src/main/java/org/nebobrod/mylibrary/EditBookActivity.java);
- BookRecViewAdapter (setOnLongClickListener);
- related methods to create new book or edit another one (getNextBookId, addToAllBook).

## What's to be improved:
- picture of Book (have to decide is it either URL with Glide or URI to local pic)
